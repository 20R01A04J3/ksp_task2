  <p>The car’s name encapsulates the true significance of all that has been achieved in terms of performance.
     The reference to the <u>90th anniversary</u> of the foundation of Scuderia Ferrari underscores the strong link that has always existed between Ferrari’s track and road cars.
      A brilliant encapsulation of the most advanced technologies developed in Maranello, the SF90 Stradale is also the perfect demonstration of how Ferrari
